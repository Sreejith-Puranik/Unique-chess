# Unique-chess

I have choose frontend file because I am intrested to code in frontend and create frontend related projects.

In this project I have built an unique chess application. In this application I have created grid of 4x3 and every block has different color and has one chess image which we can drag and drop to any block. Lastly a submit button.

You can run and test the application by downloading project files and running index.html
